no# LASU Fleet Manager

![Project Banner](./public/image.png)

An advanced fleet management system designed to streamline vehicle operations, enhance tracking, and reduce operational costs. This platform provides real-time insights into maintenance schedules, fuel consumption, and vehicle status, ensuring optimal performance and accountability.

### The Problem

- 🔴 **Delayed Maintenance**: Vehicles break down due to poorly tracked maintenance schedules.
- 🔴 **Unchecked Expenses**: Repair and fuel costs go unchecked, risking budget overruns and misuse.
- 🔴 **Scattered Data**: Vehicle information is fragmented, making it difficult to get a complete operational picture.
- 🔴 **Slow Approvals**: Manual approval processes cause unnecessary and costly vehicle downtime.
- 🔴 **Inaccurate Records**: Incomplete fuel logs hide inefficiencies and potential fraud.

### The Solution

- 🟢 **Centralized Platform**: A single source of truth for all vehicle maintenance, fuel, and status updates in real time.
- 🟢 **Transparent Tracking**: Every expense is logged with a clear audit trail to ensure accountability.
- 🟢 **Instant Approvals**: Role-based access allows Owners, Managers, and Auditors to approve requests instantly.
- 🟢 **Predictive Insights**: Automated analytics predict maintenance needs, minimizing downtime and extending vehicle life.
- 🟢 **Anomaly Detection**: Accurate fuel monitoring matches usage with vehicle activity to flag anomalies fast.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Centralized Dashboard**: A comprehensive overview of all fleet activities, including maintenance requests, fuel logs, and vehicle conditions.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Monitor vehicle status, location, and performance data in real-time.
- **Maintenance Management**: Schedule, track, and manage all vehicle maintenance activities to prevent breakdowns and minimize downtime.
- **Expense Monitoring**: Keep a detailed log of all expenses related to fuel and repairs with transparent audit trails.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Secure access for different user roles (Owner, Manager, Auditor, Admin) with specific permissions.
- **Automated Alerts**: Receive automated notifications for maintenance needs, policy violations, and other critical events.
- **Fuel Log Management**: Accurately track fuel consumption to identify inefficiencies and prevent fraud.
